#### 1.2. Recommended ML Projects Road Map

![PROJECTS!](projectroadmap.jpg.png)

Starting from two classic projects for every ML Engineer. Being the NBA Prediction a regression problem and the Credit Default a Binary Classification. Then, I implemented an Iamge Classification project with particular emphasis on the Deployment step. Finally, the three last are complete end-to-end ML projects.
