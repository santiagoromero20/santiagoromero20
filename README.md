I love facing new challenges. Even more if it will help me to grow as a professional 
and help to solve real business problems. 

Lately, I had been working on several ML projects of a wide variety of industries
and complexity. I hope you could take a look of them on my different repositories!

#### **Recommended ML Projects Road Map** 


Starting from two classic type of projects for every ML Engineer. Being is ones the NBA Prediction, a regression problem, and the Credit Default Risk Analysis a Binary Classification one.
Then, two projects more related to the Development part of an end-to-end project, puting particular enphasis on the API develop, Testing and Deployment of itself. The Social Media with FastAPI and E-Commerce Web Page with Flask.

Finally, I implemented different NLP and Computer Vision projects, all of them with the EDA of a Dataset, performing Model Evaluation and lastly putting it into production.
